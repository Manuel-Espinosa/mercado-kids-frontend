## Project Overview

This project is an open-source endeavor aimed at developing a frontend environment for an e-commerce platform designed for kids. It is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The project welcomes contributions from developers of all levels of experience and expertise.

The primary goal of this project is to create a user-friendly and visually appealing e-commerce platform that caters to the specific needs and interests of children. By providing a safe and engaging online shopping experience, the platform aims to empower young users and encourage their participation in online transactions.

The project utilizes React's component-based architecture, allowing for modular and reusable code. This promotes code organization and scalability, making it easier to add new features and enhance existing functionality.

This frontend project requires a corresponding backend application to provide the necessary data and functionality. The backend codebase for this project can be found at https://github.com/Manuel-Espinosa/mercado-kids-backend. It is essential to set up and run the backend server alongside the frontend application to ensure the proper functioning of the e-commerce platform.

Further details about the specific business logic and implementation details of the e-commerce platform will be provided in subsequent updates.

Please note that this project is for **academic purposes** only and **does not** represent a fully functional production-ready application.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
